There are two main.py.

PyPoll has Resources folder with the election_data.csv
and the main.py
 The main.py provides the total counts, the three candidates, and the winner pulled from the candidates
 This update branch update the percentages for each candidate
 and shows both types of reads since the relative path option didn't work for me
 
PyBanks has the Resources folder with the budget_data.csv
and the main.py
  The main.py provide the total months, total sum, a botched average, and greatest increase and decrease in profits.
  This updates the average change by updating and adding some variables.
